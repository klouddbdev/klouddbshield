## How to run this tool on my server ?

Postgres  -   Please read https://klouddb.io/cis-benchmarks-for-postgres-klouddbshield-1-1/

MySQL     -   Please read https://klouddb.io/releasing-first-version-of-klouddb-shield-mysql-cis-benchmarks/ 

Currently we check for about 32 controls(Postgres) and we plan to add more checks soon. We tested this tool on CentOS and Ubuntu ( PG 14 and PG13), It also includes 46 MySQL controls so a total of 78 checks as of today

NOTE -  For some linux commands you might need root/sudo access 

You can directly download the package from releases section of repo and install the package (for example - rpm for centos and deb package for Ubuntu etc..) . You also need to edit config file after installing the package(see above mentioned blog post for detailed walkthrough)


```bash
# Centos
$ rpm -i <ciscollector file>.rpm

# Debian
$ dpkg -i <ciscollector file>.deb

Usage of ciscollector:
  -r    Run
  -version
        Print version
$ ciscollector -r

## How to run locally(without installing a package) ?

Install and run locally the server

```bash
$ go build -o ./ciscollector ./cmd/ciscollector
# Edit kshieldconfig.toml at path /etc/klouddbshield/kshieldconfig.toml 
$ ./ciscollector -r
```

## [Sample config file](https://github.com/klouddb/klouddbshield/blob/main/kshieldconfig_example.toml)
Below is sample file - If you are checking for postgres comment out the mysql section or if you are only checking mysql part , comment out the postgres part. Location of the config file is /etc/klouddbshield

NOTE - In old version you will have label in config file as "[database]" instead of "[mysql]"
```
[mysql]
host="localhost"
port="3306"
# user="root"
# password="mysql111"
maxIdleConn = 2
maxOpenConn = 2

[postgres]
host="localhost" 
port="5432" 
user="postgres"
dbname="postgres"
password="postgres" 
maxIdleConn = 2
maxOpenConn = 2

[app]
debug = true

```
